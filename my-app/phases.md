Phase 1: Database & Environment Setup (Prisma, environment variables, schema, seeding)
Phase 2: Utilities & Type Definitions (shared types, API helpers, utility functions)
Phase 3: API Routes (Products, Orders, Reports, Users)
Phase 4: Shared Components (Layout, ProductCard, Cart, etc.)
Phase 5: Pages (Role selection, Cashier dashboard, Kitchen display, Reports)
Phase 6: Testing & Verification (Database, API, user flows, integration testing)
Phase 7: Polish & Optimization (metadata, error handling, loading states)

The plan follows your project requirements from projectplan.md and the database schema from db.sql. It emphasizes:

Simple, production-ready code
Role-based access control (CASHIER vs KITCHEN)
Soft delete for products (is_active flag)
Large, touch-friendly UI for restaurant use
Clear testing steps after each phase
